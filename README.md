## ReadMe
A Webpage made to give a short description of who I am and displaying my coding learning process so far. The webpage has several sections breaking up the information so that it is easy and clear to read.

The sections are:
- Personal Statement
- Brief History
- Why Xccelerate
- Hobbies and Interests

## Personal Statement
I am a friendly, motivated and creative individual. I like to spend my time cycling and hiking.I also love to go traveling, playing board games, video games, watching movies and trying out new cuisines.

## Brief History

Born and raised in Northern Ireland from a town called Enniskillen where I spent most of
my youth growing up.I studied Computer Arts at Abertay Dundee university in Scotland. 
After university I ventured to Hong kong for a vacation to relax and visit some family and friends. Ihave always loved coming back to this city as it has a lot of events and opportunities to meet new people.


Soon after I decided to stay in Hong kong and find work in the advertising and gaming industry where I
picked up various skills and then progressed to becoming a NET teacher. After a few years of teaching
even though it was rewarding I knew it wasn't for me.

## Why Xccelerate

I joined the Bootcamp so that I can continue to develop myself further and found coding
to be a desirable skill that is versatile and can be used anywhere around the world. 


I hope to use the knowledge I have gained in this bootcamp to work with others in a team where we can
all learn and grow together and for myself, gain self accomplishment from being able to code. I also
hope to get the opportunity to work on various fun projects that can make a difference in the future or
improve quality of life.
